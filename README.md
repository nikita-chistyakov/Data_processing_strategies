# Data_processing_strategies

ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) and ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) are two data processing strategies used in data pipelines. 

The key difference is when and where the data transformation happens.

Use ETL if:

- You need structured, cleaned data before loading.
- Your target system has limited processing power.
- You are working with smaller datasets in Pandas, Airflow, or Prefect.

Use ELT if:

- You’re working with large datasets and cloud data warehouses.
- You want to leverage Snowflake, BigQuery, or Redshift for transformation.
- You’re using dbt (data build tool) for SQL-based transformations.
